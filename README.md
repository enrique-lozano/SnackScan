## Translation

#### 🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣

The translations are in a json format <a href="https://github.com/enriqueloz88/SnackScan/tree/main/i18n">here</a>. To generate a new language you only have to create a new file _lang.json_ where you must replace "lang" by the code of the language in question. You can extract these codes from this <a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">link</a> looking at the ISO 639-1 Code column.

It is important that all new json files generated have exactly the same keys as the files already exposed. It is recommended to look at the _en.json_ file for reference. You can also modify any existing translation file, if you consider that any translation can be improved.
